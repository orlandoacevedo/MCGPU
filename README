Required Hardware:
    NVIDIA card with compute Compute Capability 2.0
    Tested on: NVIDIA Tesla M2070

Required Software:
    Linux Operating System
        Tested on: SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP1
    NVIDIA Developer Toolkit
        Download from http://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads based on your
        OS and follow the instructions given to install.
        Tested with: CUDA 4.2

    If you are using the Alabama Supercomputer Center(ASC) configure based on the
    instructions received when you set up your account.

    When you have both of the above installed you should be ready to build.


Build Instructions:
    >> git clone git://github.com/orlandoacevedo/MCGPU.git
    >> cd MCGPU/
    >> make

To Run a Simulation on a local machine:
    >> cd /path/to/MCGPU/
    >> cd bin/
    >> ./ParallelExample

To Run a Simulation on the Alabama Supercomputer Center:

    >> cd /path/to/MCGPU/
    >> run_gpu bin/ParallelExample
    Choose a batch job queue:
     
    Queue                 CPU    Mem # CPUs

Configuration File:
    Configuration files are used to configure a simulation. 
    Line numbers are important
    Example configuration file:
[1]     #line 1 is a comment and will be ignored
[2]     <x dimension>
[3]     <y dimension>
[4]     <z dimension>
[5]     #line 5 is a comment and will be ignored
[6]     <temperature in kelvin>
[7]     #line seven is a comment and will be ignored
[8]     <max translation for a molecule in angstroms>
[9]     #line 9 is a comment and is ignored
[10]    <number of steps for which to run the simulation> 
[11]    #line 11 is a commend and is ignored
