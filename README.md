Computational Chemistry: Monte Carlo Simulations on CPU and GPU 
===============================================================

##Requirements
###Required Hardware:
 * Nvidia graphics card with compute Compute Capability 2.0 (or greater)
    * Tested on Nvidia Tesla M2070

###Required Software:
 * Linux Operating System
    * Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP2
 * [Nvidia Developer Toolkit](http://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)
    * Tested with CUDA 4.2, 6.5

*Note*: If you are using the Alabama Supercomputer Center (ASC), configure based on the instructions received when you set up your account.

##Build
```
git clone git://github.com/orlandoacevedo/MCGPU.git
cd MCGPU/
make
```

*Note*: To build in debug mode, use BUILD=debug:
```
make BUILD=debug
```

##Run
###To Run a Simulation on a local machine:
```
cd /path/to/MCGPU/
cd bin/
./metrosim ./[configuration file] [options]
```
Where `[configuration file]` is a .config file containing configuration information, and `[options]` are command-line options. An example demo.config can be found in the resources folder. See below for specific .config file documentation and all command-line options available.

###To Run a Simulation on the Alabama Supercomputer Center:
```
cd /path/to/MCGPU/
run_gpu demo_script.txt
```
Choose a batch job queue:
```
Queue                 CPU    Mem # CPUs
-------------- ---------- ------ ------
small-serial     40:00:00    4gb      1 
medium-serial    90:00:00   16gb      1 
large-serial    240:00:00  120gb      1 
class             2:00:00   64gb   1-64 
daytime           4:00:00   16gb    1-4 
express          01:00:00  500mb      1
```

```
Enter Queue Name (default <cr>: small-serial) <must be a serial queue>
Enter Time Limit (default <cr>: 40:00:00 HH:MM:SS) <enter time limit>
Enter memory limit (default <cr>: 500mb) <enter required memory>
Enter GPU architecture [t10/fermi/any] (default <cr>: any) <fermi>
```

You standard out for your job will be written to 
```
<jobname>.o<job number>
```

###To Run a Simulation on the Alabama Supercomputer Center in debug mode:
```
gpu_interactive

What architecture GPU do you want [any,t10,fermi,kepler]: <kepler>
Do you want to use X-windows [y/n]: <n>

cd /path/to/MCGPU/
cd bin/
./metrosim ./[configuration file]
```

For more information, see the Alabama Supercomputer Center manual.

##Available Command-line Options
 * `--serial`: Runs simulation serially (on CPU; default)
 * `--parallel`: Runs simulation in parallel (on GPU; requries CUDA)
 * `--list-devices`: Lists available CUDA-capable devices (requires CUDA)
 * `--device <index>`: Specifies what device to use when running a simulation. Index refers to one given in --list-devices. (requires CUDA)
 * `--threads <count>`: Specifies number of threads to use when running on CPU (serial only)
 * `--name <title>`: Specifies the name of the simulation that will be run.
 * `--steps <count>`: Specifies how many simulation steps to execute in the Monte Carlo Metropolis algorithm. Ignores steps to run in config file, if present (line 10).
 * `--silent`: Disables real time energy printouts

To view documentation for all command-line flags available, use the --help flag:
```
./metrosim --help
```

##Configuration File
Configuration files are used to configure a simulation. 
Line numbers are important
